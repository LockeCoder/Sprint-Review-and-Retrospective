Interpreting user needs requires actively engaging with stakeholders and understanding their goals, often translated into features or functionalities that the program must deliver. In Agile, user profiles play an essential role in this process. A user story is a simple, direct product description from the userâ€™s perspective. By focusing on user profiles, developers can align their work with real user needs, ensuring that every aspect of the program delivers value. This process also facilitates incremental improvement, where each case represents a small, manageable project that can be developed, tested, and reviewed again and again

I approach developing programs by following an Agile framework emphasizing iterative development, continuous feedback, and flexibility. This process starts with gathering requirements converted into user stories in a prioritized backlog. I work on the most critical stories during each sprint, ensuring the product is developed incrementally. Test-driven development (TDD) ensures that the code meets required quality standards. In my future development projects, I hope to incorporate Agile techniques such as continuous integration, daily leveling, and continuous follow-up to encourage constant improvement and change.

Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to team goals while promoting collaboration. This includes open communication, knowledge sharing, and helping others overcome obstacles. A good team member is flexible, open to feedback, and willing to improve continuously. In an Agile environment, this means participating in daily scrums, being open to feedback during sprint reviews, and contributing ideas during retrospectives to help the team refine processes. Discussion tools like JIRA help provide clarity, make sure everyone is aligned, work towards the same goals, and do that.
